# Node.js Express Project with MongoDB

Welcome to our open-source Node.js Express project with MongoDB! We are thrilled to have you here and look forward to your valuable contributions. Below you will find instructions and guidelines to get you started with the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- Ensure you have a MongoDB server running. If not, you can download and install it from [MongoDB Official Site](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nodejs-express-mongodb.git
cd nodejs-express-mongodb
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

Replace `your_mongodb_uri` with the actual connection URI of your MongoDB server.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with nodemon for automatic reloading.
- `npm run test`: Runs the tests using mocha.

### Contributing Guidelines

1. **Branching**: Create a new branch for each feature, bugfix, or chore. Branch from `main` and use the following naming convention: `feature/your-feature-name`, `bugfix/your-bugfix-name`, or `chore/your-chore-name`.
2. **Code Quality**: Ensure your code adheres to our coding standards by running `npm run lint` (assuming a linter is set up). Ensure your code passes all tests by running `npm run test`. If you are adding new features, please add corresponding tests.
3. **Committing and Pushing**: Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes you have made. Once your branch is ready, create a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch. Ensure your PR passes all Continuous Integration (CI) checks and has been reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging.
4. **Pull Requests**: Clearly describe the purpose of the PR and the impact of the changes. Include any additional context or screenshots if necessary. Once your PR has been reviewed and approved, and all CI checks have passed, you may merge your changes into `main`.

### Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and considerate of others. For more details, refer to the Code of Conduct file.
