## Branching
Create a new branch for every feature, bugfix, or chore. Branch from main and use the following naming convention: feature/your-feature-name, bugfix/your-bugfix-name, or chore/your-chore-name.

Run npm run lint before committing to ensure your code adheres to our linting standards.
Run npm run test to ensure your code passes all tests. If you are adding new features, please add corresponding tests.

## Committing and Pushing
Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes you have made.
Once your branch is ready, create a Pull Request (PR) against the main branch.
Ensure your PR passes all Continuous Integration (CI) checks and has been reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging.

Include any additional context or screenshots if necessary.
Once your PR has been reviewed and approved, and all CI checks have passed, you may merge your changes into main.
